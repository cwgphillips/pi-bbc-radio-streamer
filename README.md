# pi-bbc-radio-streamer
Stream radio with python, mpv, Raspberry Pi and Pirate-Audio hat.

We can't get good DAB signal in our kitchen so I wanted a simple radio with physical buttons I could stream radio. 

Streaming BBC radio seems to be harder than I thought but http://www.radiofeeds.co.uk/ provide loads of feeds you can use to stream many radio stations, including BBC.

This impliments a simple mpv player (https://mpv.io/) via a python app to stream radio (including BBC 6 music! ðŸ˜Š) from an _.m3u8_ file.
